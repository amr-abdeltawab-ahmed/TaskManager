Task Manager.
a task manager to see running processes on operating system (OS). A program
is an executable file stored on hard disk. A process is a program running in the memory by OS. A process

Create a class to represent process, create a class that represents list of running processes. Add functions
to fill it with processes information and to allow displaying the processes as in the picture below (1)
sorted by name, (2) sorted by PID and sorted by memory use. Add a function that gets the list of
processes from OS and loads the process list. Write a program to test your classes.
